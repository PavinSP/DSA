- Linear search is applicable to any kind of array, but binary search is only
applicable to sorted arrays.

Time Complexity: The measure of how the running time of an algorithm increases with
the size of input data.

Big O notation: (Order of)

O(1): constant time
O(log n): logarithmic time
O(n): linear time
O(n log n): linearithmic time
O(n^2): quadratic time
O(2^n): exponential time
O(n!): factorial time

Linear search:
- Searching: O(n) - 5 values 5 steps, 100 values 100 steps.
- Reading: O(1) - constant time no matter the size is.

Binary search:
- Searching: O(log n) - suppose 7 values 3 steps, when doubled (14 values) 4 steps.
