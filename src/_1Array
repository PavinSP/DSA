Array:

- Reading is easy in arrays because we know the index.
- Searching is difficult because we don't know where the value is present (at which index).
- Insertion is also difficult (except when we want to insert at last element).
- Time complexity (General): no of steps it takes to run the program

- Space complexity: less memory
- Time complexity: less time
